# TrafficGenPy
Just a small Python Script to increase page-views on your blog. Tested on Blogspot Blogs.  
I am working on a Docker implementation but for now there are some requirements to run the script.

### System Requirements
* Your system must have Tor installed
* Tor service must have the control port at 9051
* Python 3

### Python dependencies
* stem
* fake_useragent
